# Employee-Directory



It's a react application that makes an API call and get a number of random employee,
because we don't have a database in this application yet.
user can search in the employee by name, using first or last name.
also you can arrange the employees by name by clicking on the Name on the table or arrange them  by  age by clicking on the DOB.

This when we search for Dan.
Note: if we have several employees with the same name or with that name as last name they would appear too.
